Welcome to my GitHub profile!

As a Lead Data Engineer and Applications Consultant, I am passionate about transforming complex data into actionable insights. I specialize in creating advanced ETL pipelines and leveraging machine learning techniques to deliver innovative data solutions that drive strategic business decisions.

I thrive on challenges and am dedicated to continuously improving my skills in Microsoft Azure stacks, dbt, Databricks, and Python for data wrangling. My experience spans across the insurance and retail sectors, where I've successfully enabled teams to uncover critical customer insights, inform investment strategies, and enhance performance.

Collaboration and communication are at the heart of my approach. With a multilingual background, I enjoy working with diverse teams to solve complex problems and achieve shared goals.

Let's connect and create data-driven solutions that make a difference!
